If you use `next()` over a python set, you will only see the first one\n- Then within the context of `A` there is no reference to `a_main`, so reference is correctly empty. If you want to see the reference, you need to access the function `A.a_main()` that lives in the contract B or C.  \n\nFunctions and contracts are duplicate based on their inheritance usage, as it's needed for static analysis. Happy to continue this discussion on github to not add noise here. But we definitely have room for improvements in the documentation of slither's internals.\n\nHowever saying slither cannot be trusted because you identify a potential bug sounds extreme tbh \ud83d\ude42 (in particular if the bug is in your script \ud83d\ude05)"
